## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The data set we chose is about medical insurance cost across each region of the United States. With this analytics project we hope to find whether certain groups in this data get charged more for their medical expenses due to factors like age, sex, BMI, number of children, their region and if they are a non smoker or smoker. We are interested in this topic because we want to find out which age group or region spends the most on their medical expenses. Some questions would be: which age group spends the most on medical expenses, is there correlation between the charges and number of children had and does BMI affect the person's charges as well. Finally, for the data set we chose we can build a user-facing dashboard because we can use the data provided to explore whether or not people in different age groups or different regions are paying too much for their medical bills.
